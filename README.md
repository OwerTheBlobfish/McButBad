# McButBad
  Welcome to a small experiment on classes, designed to be a fun small project that you can mess around with.
  
  It is coded in 100% Javascript and could probably be way more efficient. Made by a 12 year-old
  Just paste into a web Javascript console and wait for it to load. 
  You may have to visit the Minecraft Wiki page linked below for the images to load.
  
  You can use mouse controls or console controls, all explained in the project itself.
  This is free to use, have fun!
